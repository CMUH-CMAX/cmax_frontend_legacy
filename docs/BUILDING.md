# Introduction

powered by [`svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install

# or with npm
npm install
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev # pnpm run dev

npm run dev

## or run the project with different host and port
npm run dev -- --host $HOST --port $PORT

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
